# My big header

We are using Pandoc-flavored Markdown.

## Sub header

I am a paragraph. I can spread on several
lines, just link in emails.

A blank line separates two paragraphs.

# Lists

## Ordered lists

It's simple:

1. First item gives the first number, afterwards, it auto-increments
1. This is item 2
1. This is 3
    4. This is item 3.4
    5. This is item 3.5
    2. This is item 3.6

## Unordered list

* This is an unordered list
+ Different markers can be used
   * They can also be nested

# Links and images

This is [a link to EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch).

![I am the image caption](Figures/image.png)

You want to talk about an old guy. Juste cite his publication [@oldguy]. And in case you
need footnotes^[here you go!].

# Text formatting

This paragraph contains *italic* text. And here comes **bold**. And now
the infamous ***bold and italic*** monster.

# Formulas

Just use the LaTeX style:

$\sum_{i=0,\ i\neq j}^n u_{ij}$

# Quotes

The quote system is just like emails:

> I am a legit quote
spreading over several lines.

> I am another quote spreading
> over multiple lines too.

# References
